## Overview

A compilation of resources related to Network Automation & Programming

## The Value of Network Automation
Network automation and NetSecDevOps bring efficiency, agility, and security to network management. Automation streamlines repetitive tasks like device configurations, monitoring, and troubleshooting, which reduces human error and frees up valuable time for strategic activities. In a NetSecDevOps approach, security, networking, and development teams work collaboratively, ensuring that security is integrated into every step of the development and deployment process. This close collaboration and integration allow for faster response to security threats, more consistent policy enforcement, and smoother deployments, ultimately enabling secure, resilient, and scalable networks.

This article provides a curated list of links and resources designed to help you explore key topics in network automation and NetSecDevOps. These resources offer valuable insights, practical guides, and best practices to deepen your understanding of automation tools, methodologies, and security-focused DevOps approaches. By utilizing these links, youâ€™ll gain access to a variety of expert perspectives, tutorials, and frameworks that support streamlined network management, enhanced security practices, and seamless integration across development, security, and operations teams.
