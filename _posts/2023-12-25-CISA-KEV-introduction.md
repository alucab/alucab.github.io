# Understanding CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog

The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog stands as a critical resource curated by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to aid in identifying vulnerabilities actively exploited by cybercriminals. It combines automated scanning, manual monitoring, and collaboration with industry experts to compile a list of vulnerabilities exploited in recent attacks.

## Characteristics of Vulnerabilities in the KEV Catalog

Vulnerabilities listed within the KEV Catalog possess specific attributes that distinguish them. These characteristics include:

- **Assigned CVE ID:** Each vulnerability in the catalog is associated with a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID, providing a standardized reference point for identification and tracking.

- **Evidence of Active Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities listed have reliable evidence showcasing active exploitation by cybercriminals in real-world scenarios. This evidence includes instances of attempted or successful execution of malicious code without the system owner's authorization. Events like scanning, security research of an exploit, or Proof of Concept (PoC) don't constitute active exploitation within the context of the KEV Catalog.

- **Availability of Remediation Actions:** For a vulnerability to be included in the KEV Catalog, there must be a clear path to remediation. This often involves the existence of vendor-provided updates, patches, or specific mitigation techniques to address the vulnerability effectively.

These characteristics serve as key markers for vulnerabilities deemed critical, necessitating immediate attention and remediation to fortify the security posture of organizations and individuals against known threats.



## Importance and Usage

The KEV Catalog serves as a crucial tool for organizations and individuals, allowing them to prioritize remediation efforts effectively. Here are a few examples of its usage for prioritization:

1. **Patch Management:** Organizations leverage the KEV Catalog to identify critical vulnerabilities within their systems. By aligning the listed vulnerabilities with available patches, they prioritize applying these patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

2. **Risk Assessment:** Security teams use the KEV Catalog to conduct risk assessments within their networks. By understanding which vulnerabilities are actively exploited, they allocate resources to address those posing the highest risk first, enhancing their overall security posture.

3. **Threat Intelligence Integration:** The catalog's data is integrated into threat intelligence platforms, enabling automated vulnerability scanning and providing insights for proactive threat mitigation strategies.

## Regulatory Impact

The regulatory impact of the KEV Catalog is primarily observed within the United States. While the catalog itself is a global resource, U.S. federal civilian executive branch agencies are mandated to remediate vulnerabilities listed within it under [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities). 
However, all organizations, regardless of mandate, are encouraged to prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities to enhance their security posture.

## CISA KEV Google Spreadsheet

I've developed a [CISA KEV Spreadsheet][CISA_GSHEET] directly sourced from the CISA KEV Catalog, updated automatically every 24 hours. It's a basic data source without any elaborations to allow direct analysis.

Here a sample

<div style="text-align: center"> 
<iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="500px" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ2rjzP8U9wgDcgP-HEsag9E1Gz3QG2ED8OGioPMnVuCjvwm8pGhsdapgsfadO0JO3xYdcUa6kEa61t/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
</div>

This easily accessible resource provides several benefits:

- **Real-Time Information:** Having data refreshed regularly ensures access to the latest information on actively exploited vulnerabilities, aiding in swift decision-making for vulnerability remediation.

- **Convenience and Ease of Use:** With the spreadsheet readily available and updated automatically, organizations and individuals can conveniently access and utilize the data without the need for manual updates or checks. It's easy to grap it and create visualization or analyses without manual CSV imports or JSON parsing

- **Easiness of Integration:** Google Spreadsheet is a format extremely powerful and diffused. It is also easily integrated in Google Looker Studio without need for CSV imports to be refreshed, scripts, or external connectors

- **Enhanced Security Posture:** Immediate access to refreshed vulnerability information empowers swift action, allowing for quicker vulnerability resolution, thereby strengthening the overall cybersecurity posture.


Utilizing and maintaining access to a continuously updated spreadsheet derived from the CISA KEV Catalog ensures that organizations and individuals have a reliable, easily accessible resource to bolster their cybersecurity defenses against known and actively exploited vulnerabilities.
