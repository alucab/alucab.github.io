## What is this?â€‹
A collection of vulnerability and cybersecurity resources in easily accessible formats for lazy people. 

### What's here for me ?
Navigating hundreds of thousands of NVD vulnerabilities can be  difficult and time consuming. 
Several data sources supply data with API, data files and so on. In many cases the existing API are excessively verbose and detailed, so that querying them can be extremely inconvenient.

This can be sometimes a hassle especially if you want to create quick visualizations or analyses. 

This projects aims to create interactive Google spreadsheets and Looker dashboards to amalgamate crucial cybersecurity insights without complex tools or websites. 

### Why these tools ?
Because they are free and relatively powerful. They don't require installations, containers, servers. You cannot do everything but you can surely do a lot of things.

### How do I use this?

It's really easy, just plug and play! 
- The spreadsheets are automatically updated, you can use them as you like
- For the dashboards, click and play with the various filters and views to slice down vulnerabilities and to study the relation between KEV and EPSS 
- Read and comment the articles.

Hopefully, this will help to understand a bit better your vulnerability posture. 

## Features

- Google Spreadsheets or other easy formats to access relevant Cyber Security Data
- Beautiful visualizations and dashboards built mainly with Google Looker Studio
- Articles or sources I find useful or interesting
- RSS Feed
- In-built sitemap


## Resources

- [EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/epss/data_stats)
- [CISA KEV (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)

## Warning - Work in Progress
This project is a work in progress. 
Expect more features and enhancements in the future to further augment its functionality and utility.
